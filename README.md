### You: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, Richer
Obsessively private, world class software to help better yourself and the rest of humanity. Open source and free to run on your server. This is the master repository of Athena Alpha and contains the framework for orchestration of all containerized services.

## Features

#### Your Data: Private & Controlled By You
Running Athena Alpha on your own server gives you the ultimate control over your data. No more centralised "free" services [selling your private data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and) to data brokers, [getting hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) or secretly sharing it with governments. Your data has nothing to do with someone else's business model. It's part of your private life, and now it can all be stored by you, at home, with a world class interface, for free.
