## ðŸ”¥ Features

#### Your Data: Private & Controlled By You
Running Athena Alpha on your own server gives you the ultimate control over your data. No more centralised "free" services [selling your private data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and) to data brokers, [getting hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) or secretly sharing it with governments. Your data has nothing to do with someone else's business model. It's part of your private life, and now it can all be stored by you, at home, with a world class interface, for free.
